LED Toggle Application for Arduino
Overview
This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling an LED connected to an Arduino board. Through the GUI, users can toggle the state of the LED (HIGH or LOW) by communicating with the Arduino over a serial port.

Features
Port Selection: Users can choose the Arduino port from the available options.
Pin Configuration: Select the pin number on the Arduino to control the LED.
Baud Rate Setting: Specify the baud rate for communication with the Arduino.
Toggle LED State: Buttons to set the selected pin HIGH or LOW.
Real-time Feedback: Messages are displayed in a richTextBox to indicate actions performed.
